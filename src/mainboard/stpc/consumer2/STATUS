#status: One of unsupported, unstable, stable
status: stable
explanation: okay except tv-out, tv-in not setup properly; rtc?- hwclock very slow in linux
flash-types: AT49F040-70PC
payload-types: 
# e.g. linux, plan 9, wince, etc.
OS-types: linux
# e.g. "Plan 9 interrupts don't work on this chipset"
OS-issues: linux hwclock hangs for 20 seconds and reports wrong value.  Change irqs to be used in src/mainboard/stpc/consumer2/mainboard.c; irq table is dynamic with the checksum calculated on startup; ram must be enabled at 0xf0000 for irq table to be written (done by default).
console-types: serial, vga-text
# vga is unsupported, unstable, or stable
vga: stable
# Last-known-good follows the internationl date standard: day/month/year
last-known-good: 17/12/2002
Comments: 4 bit 640x400 graphics is supported for a startup logo screen, followed by 80x25 vga text console.  Not sure if vga clock is set correctly but it is close.
