Not all these patches have been tested together. It's harder than you think. 
We will be hopefully shipping more unified patches soon.

For 440BX users: 
irq_route.diff is Tyson Sawyer's patch to properly handle LINUXBIOS kernels.
It has been tested on 2.4.0-test6 kernels. 
---
For SiS630 users: Use the linux-2.4.0-test12-sis630-sisfb_lite.patch ONLY.
There is also a sameple kernel configuration file config-2.4.0-test12.sis.
This will build a kernel that works with LinuxBIOS.
