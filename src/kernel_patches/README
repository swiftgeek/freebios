Not all these patches have been tested together. It's harder than you think. 
We will be hopefully shipping more unified patches soon.

For 440BX users: 
irq_route.diff is Tyson Sawyer's patch to properly handle LINUXBIOS kernels.
It has been tested on 2.4.0-test6 kernels. 
---
For SiS630 users: Use the linux-2.4.0-test11-sis630-fat-sisfb.patch ONLY. This
will build a kernel that works with LinuxBIOS.
