EXPERIMENTAL

This directory contains PIRQ tables. 

The PIRQ table is stored in the PC at are in between 0xF0000 and 0xFFFFF.
It is distinguished by "$PIR" string at start of table is around 256 bytes
long.

So just like video bios we attemtp to grab it and save it. The support for
grabbing is not complete in the Makefile and resulting file still will
have to be hand edited (if anyone want to hack 'grep' to have -A an -B
return char count instead of line count while in binary mode, volunters
are welcome).

			--------------

PIRQ support is not complete yet.
