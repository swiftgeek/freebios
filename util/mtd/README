These are scripts for burning DoC. The DoC support as of 2.4.7 and 
later should be fine. Be sure to set up (in drivers/mtd/devices/docprobe.c)
#undef DOC_SINGLE_DRIVER

Also use the millenium-only driver when you config your kernel. 

Also I'm including the mtd erase.c here for those who don't have it.
