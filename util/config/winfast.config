# Sample config file for Winfast 6300 with DoC Millennium (as root)

# This will make a target directory of ./winfast
target winfast 

# Add -DSIS630 in Makefile to enable SIS630 specific feature
# Fixme: -DSIS630 should be determined from target or mainboard
option SIS630

# WinFast 6300 MAX mainboard
mainboard leadtek/winfast6300

# Enable Serial Console for debugging
option SERIAL_CONSOLE

# Use DoC Millennium as our storage device
option USE_DOC_MIL
option INBUF_COPY

# Fixme: when docipl is issued the -DUSE_DOC_MIL and
# -DINBUF_COPY should be issued automatically.
docipl northsouthbridge/sis/630

# Use the internal VGA frame buffer device
# Fixme: this does not effect the Makefile rules for docipl
option HAVE_FRAMEBUFFER

# we have to figure a better way than this!
