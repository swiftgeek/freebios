Cd to webconfig/server and run 
./pyserv.py -f <your cvs checkout>/freebios &

Then you can browse to http://localhost:8083/cgi-bin/index.py

Select a manufacturer, click enter. Select a mainboard, click
enter. Then you get sent to a new CGI script that puts up
the beginnings of a form to fill out the details for that
mainboard. The next thing to do, IMHO, is to build some
mechanism to present to the user a list of options and
value entry fields which are relevent to the selected
mainboard.
