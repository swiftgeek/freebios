	This is the bare metal toolkit for LinuxBIOS.

It was produced and is maintained by Steven James <pyro@linuxlabs.com>

It's purpose is to simplify development of standalone ELF executables suitable 
as a payload for LinuxBIOS.  Two examples are included, hello  and bootselect. 
Most of this toolkit comes from LinuxBIOS itself. A few pieces are borrowed 
from Etherboot (such as code to locate and use the LinuxBIOS table).

It is important to note that even though the main part is a Library, Since
it is built from GPL code, it falls under GPL, not LGPL. This may matter to
you in production since that means your project will also need to be GPL in
order to be linked with this toolkit. 

This is an early release. It has been used successfully to produce several 
payloads. However, as it is an early release, if you intend to use the payloads 
in production, it may be best to maintain your own production snapshot for a bit.

	Hello is a simple example program. All it does is say hello, then you 
hit reset :-)

	Bootselect allows for multiple choice payloads. It scans the flash ROM 
for tagged executable images and checks to see if a character is waiting on the 
serial console. If not, the first image is run immediatly.  If a character is 
waiting, it is dropped, a list of tagged images is presented. The user selects 
the image by number. This can come in quite handy for testing, or for loading 
diagnostic and other secondary firmware.
