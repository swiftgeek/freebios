* 1.16 29 August 2002

 - Initial cross compiling support thanks to Jake Page <jake@CS.Stanford.EDU>
 - Official specfile thanks to Andrew Ip <aip@cwlinux.com>

* 1.14 28 June 2002
 - Use much less complex ld magic (removed the use of PHDRS directive)
 - Fix a small bug in the LinuxBIOS checksum verification code (only affected odd length tables)

* 1.13 10 May 2002
  Include the version number in mkelfImage.

* 1.12 26 January 2002
  Better firmware detection, and stripping excess symbols from the
  generated object.

* 1.11 24 January 2002 
  Bug fix to command line processing.
 
* 1.10 21 January 2002
  Starting using the PHDRS directive which many versions of ld cannot
  handle correctly.  The symptom is generally a file that is 9MB in
  size.

  Start computing a checksum on the Image.

  Include an ELF note section in the image for out of band
  information (checksum, program name, etc).

* 1.9 7 January 2002
  I changed LinuxBIOS (in LinuxBIOS) from passing it's information
  locally, to passing it in a global table that is always present.
  So that whoever needs that information can get it unfiltered.  And
  because it isn't being passed around it has less chance of
  becomming corrupt.  Globals for global information are good :)
  Version 1.9 goes out and finds that table.

* 1.8 10 December 2001
  Move the ramdisk up even higher in memory.
  Better debugging of multiboot parameters
  Pass the correct values for a vga screen instead of telling the
  kernel we have EGA...

* 1.7 18 May 2001
  Warn when I don't have information about the bootloader.
  Include a ELF compreressor that works on alpha && x86
  There is no good way to apply it though.

* 1.6 1 Febuary 2001
  Code cleanup in bzImage support.

* 1.5 1 Febuary 2001
  Add support for bzImage 

* 1.4 ???
  ???

* 1.3 27 December 2000
  Minor bug fixes for working with the e820 memory map.

* 1.2 18 December 2000
  Work around for some versions of ld not treating /dev/null and an
  empty file the same 

* 1.1 30 November 2000
  Fix for ramdisks and large amounts of memory with 2.2 series
  kernels.

* 1.0 7 November 2000
  Initial release (supports vmlinux && bvmlinux)
